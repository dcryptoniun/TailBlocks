## Getting Started with Brainless UI ðŸš€

Welcome to Brainless UI! In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to get started with using our open-source UI component library. The best part? There's no installation requiredâ€”just copy and paste the code snippets. However, please make sure you have Tailwind CSS installed, which you can learn more about in the official [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

### Step 1: Install Tailwind CSS

Before diving into Brainless UI, you need to have Tailwind CSS installed in your project. Follow the installation instructions provided in the [official Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to set up Tailwind CSS in your development environment.

### Step 2: Copy and Paste Brainless UI Components

Once you have Tailwind CSS installed, you're ready to start using Brainless UI components. Simply navigate to the Brainless UI library and find the component you need from our comprehensive collection.

Copy the code snippet for the desired component and paste it into your project's HTML or template file. Make sure to include the necessary Tailwind CSS classes as mentioned in the component documentation to ensure proper styling.

### Step 3: Customize and Modify

Brainless UI components are designed to be highly customizable. Feel free to modify the code and Tailwind CSS classes to match your specific design requirements. Tailwind CSS provides a rich set of utility classes that you can leverage to tweak the appearance and behavior of the components.

Experiment with different variations, colors, and sizes to achieve the desired look and feel. Refer to the Tailwind CSS documentation for a comprehensive list of utility classes and customization options.

### Step 4: Iterate and Build
